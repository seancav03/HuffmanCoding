## Usage:
1. Run the main method in Compress.java to begin.
2. You will be prompted to specify whether you want to encode or decode a file, choose one.
3. Provide the path to the file you want to encode/decode. If you are compressing, try Directories/large_text.txt, or if you are decompressing, try compressed_text.txt. These two files are the large and compressed versions of the same text.
4. Provide the path of an output file (The file will be created if does not exist).
5. Wait for "Done" and view your output!
